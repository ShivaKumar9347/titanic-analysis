# Titanic Survival Prediction
A data analysis and machine learning project using the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. This project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model comparison using Python.

ðŸ“„ Overview
The Titanic dataset is a well-known beginner dataset for classification tasks. The goal is to analyze passenger data and build predictive models to determine which passengers survived the disaster.

ðŸ’¡ Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.

Clean data, handle outliers, and preprocess features.

Encode categorical variables for modeling.

Build and evaluate classification models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Visualize insights and model performance.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
Summary statistics: Data types, missing values, and descriptive stats.

Visualizations:

Count plots (e.g., gender distribution).

Histograms (age distribution).

Heatmaps (feature correlations).

Boxplots (Pclass vs. family aboard).

Pair plots colored by sex.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled outliers in Siblings/Spouses Aboard using the IQR method.

Dropped non-informative columns like Name.

Label encoded categorical columns (e.g., Sex).

Split data into training and testing sets.

ðŸ¤– Model Building
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Used n_neighbors=3.

Evaluated using accuracy score.

Decision Tree Classifier
Used max_depth=3 for interpretability.

Evaluated with accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
